# Overview
This repository contains both the data processing pipeline to generate intermediate files from the raw experimental data, as well as Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and plotting, for the error characterization and figures in the following publication:

> Gimpel, A.L., Stark, W.J., Heckel, R., Grass R.N. Challenges for error-correction coding in DNA data storage: photolithographic synthesis and DNA decay. bioRxiv 2024.07.04.602085 (2024). https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.04.602085

The program `dt4dds-challenges`, providing a digital benchmark for current challenges in DNA data storage, is found in the [dt4dds-challenges repository](https://github.com/fml-ethz/dt4dds-challenges).

# Software requirements
The data processing pipeline is implemented with bash scripts, to be run either locally or on a computing cluster. The data analysis scripts can be run locally as Jupyter notebooks.

## Data processing pipeline
The data processing pipeline has been tested and performed on Ubuntu 23.10. The following software is required:
```
bbmap (v39.01)
dt4dds-challenges (v1.0.0)
kalign (v3.4.0)
NGmerge (v0.3)
Python (v3.12.3) with dt4dds (v1.1.0)
```
In addition, standard command line tools such as git and wget are required.


## Data analysis scripts
The data analysis scripts have been tested and were run on Windows 10 using Python 3.12. The following Python packages are required: 
```
dt4dds==1.1.0
pandas==2.2.2
numpy==1.26.4
statsmodels==0.14.2
plotly==5.20.0
scipy==1.13.0
biopython==1.83
numba==0.59.1
rapidfuzz==3.8.1
edlib==1.3.9
```
In addition, running the Jupyter notebooks requires a local Jupyter installation.


# Installation guide
To clone this repository from Github, use:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fml-ethz/dt4dds-challenges_notebooks
cd dt4dds-challenges_notebooks
```

If you intend to re-run the data processing pipelines, install the required software locally with:
```bash
./00_Tools/bbmap/install.sh
./00_Tools/dt4dds-challenges/install.sh
./00_Tools/kalign/install.sh
./00_Tools/ngmerge/install.sh
pip install dt4dds=1.1.0
```

In order to run the data processing pipelines, the raw experimental data must be downloaded from their respective sources. For this, run the download scripts provided in the subfolders of [`./data_experimental/`](/data_experimental/):
```bash
./data_experimental/Aging_Meiser/setup.sh
./data_experimental/Aging_Song/setup.sh
./data_experimental/Photolithography_Antkowiak/setup.sh
./data_experimental/Photolithography_Lietard/setup.sh
```
Note that the sequencing dataset "CB_120" by Lietard et al. has not been deposited publicly and must be requested from the original authors. To run the data processing pipeline for this dataset, manually copy the read files as `R1_original.fq.gz` and `R2_original.fq.gz` into [the respective subfolder at ./data_experimental/Photolithographic_Lietard/high_density](/data_experimental/Photolithographic_Lietard/high_density). See also the Section on [Data Sources](#data-sources).

Moreover, the error-correction codes used for the benchmarking in `50_Simulation` need to be installed from their respective sources. For this, run the installation scripts provided in [`./50_Simulation/simulator/codecs`](/50_Simulation/simulator/codecs/):
```bash
./50_Simulation/simulator/codecs/DBGPS/install.sh
./50_Simulation/simulator/codecs/dna_rs_coding/install.sh
./50_Simulation/simulator/codecs/dnafountain/install.sh
```
See also the Section on [Codec Sources](#codec-sources).

Finally, install the Python packages required for running the data analysis scripts:
```bash
pip install dt4dds=1.1.0 numpy pandas scipy statsmodels plotly
```
and download the external dataset for comparing coverage bias:
```bash
wget -P ./30_Photolithographic https://github.com/uwmisl/storage-biasing-ncomms20/blob/master/data/run36.npy 
```




# Usage guide
The data processing pipelines must not be run prior to running the data analysis, as all intermediate file generated by the data processing pipelines are already provided in this repository. Nonetheless, if re-running the data processing pipelines is desired, follow the following steps. Otherwise, skip the steps outlined for the data processing pipeline and move directly to the data analysis scripts.

## Data processing pipeline
There are two options for running the data processing pipelines: locally or on a cluster (using Slurm Workload Manager). For both, the scripts are provided in the subfolders of [`./data_experimental/`](/data_experimental/), either as `local.sh` for local processing, or as `slurm.sh` for processing with Slurm. As an example for local processing, run:
```bash
./data_experimental/Aging_Meiser/local.sh
./data_experimental/Aging_Song/local.sh
./data_experimental/Photolithography_Antkowiak/local.sh
./data_experimental/Photolithography_Lietard/local.sh
```
This will re-create the intermediate files located in the `analysis` folder of each individual dataset.

To run the codec tests, scripts are provided in the [`./50_Simulation/`](/50_Simulation/) directory. For each codec, design files for the different encoders and code rates have been created by running:
```bash
python3 50_Simulation/create_design_files.py
```
which will be deposited in [`./data_simulated/`](/data_simulated/) subdirectories.

Then, a choice of scenario (`test`, `decay`, or `photolithography`), codec (`DBGPS`, `DNARS`, or `DNAFOUNTAIN`), and code rate (e.g., `1.10`) can be run with:
```bash
python3 50_Simulation/runner.py <SCENARIO> <CODEC> <CODERATE>
```
The resulting intermediate files will also be placed in the respective [`./data_simulated/`](/data_simulated/) subdirectories.


## Data analysis scripts
The Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and plotting are distributed across the four directories [`./21_BeadCleanup/`](./21_BeadCleanup/), [`./30_Photolithography/`](./30_Photolithography/), [`./40_Aging/`](./40_Aging/), and [`./50_Simulation/`](./50_Simulation/). In each directory, multiple notebooks use the intermediate files created by the data processing pipelines to analyse an aspect of the error and bias patterns.

Each Jupyter notebook can be independently run locally to reproduce the plots presented in the manuscript.






# Data sources
Some of the analysis in this repository is based on sequencing data from other publications. Download and processing scripts are provided in the respective folders to download and post-process the sequencing data as required by the analysis scripts. This is only required if re-running the full pipeline starting from the sequencing data is desired. The intermediate files for data analysis are already provided with this repository.
